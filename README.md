# Form-Validation
This is a form-validation mini project made by using pure javascript,boostrap.
So basically, It checks that a form is valid or not which means when you fill a form then it checks that the information is entered by a user is correct or not.
ie. When a user enters its phone number then it should be 10 digit long, when a user enters its email id then it should not start with any specific symnbol like $,# etc.
when a user enters its name then its name should not start with any digit or specific symbol like $,# etc.
